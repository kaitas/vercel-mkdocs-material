Troubleshooting

404 Errors: If you encounter 404 errors after deploying, double-check the following:

Ensure that your package.json file has a build script that runs mkdocs build -d public.

Confirm that the outputDirectory in your vercel.json file is set to public.

Verify that your mkdocs.yml file specifies site_dir: public.

Clear your Vercel project's cache by redeploying and unchecking "Use existing build cache."

Other Build Errors: Most build errors are caused by typos in mkdocs.yml or missing packages in requirements.txt. Carefully review your recent changes and the Vercel build logs for clues.
