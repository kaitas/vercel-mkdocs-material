**MkDocs with Material for MkDocs theme, easily deployed to Vercel (minimal configuration). Includes blog functionality using mkdocs-blog-plugin.**

- [â–² Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd <your_repository_directory>
```

Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the URL of your Git repository and `<your_repository_directory>` with the name of the directory you want to clone the project into.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs the necessary Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file, including `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, and `mkdocs-blog-plugin`.

### 3. Configure MkDocs

*   Edit `mkdocs.yml` to customize your site. This includes:
    *   Setting the `site_name`, `site_description`, and `site_author`.
    *   Configuring the `theme`, `palette`, `font`, and `features`.
    *   Adding a `nav` section to structure your documentation (optional). If you omit the `nav` section, MkDocs will automatically generate a navigation menu based on your file structure.
*   Add your documentation content as Markdown files (`.md`) in the `docs` directory.
*   Add blog posts as Markdown files in the `docs/blog/posts` directory. Each blog post should have a filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md` and include YAML front matter for the title and date:

```markdown
---
title: Your Blog Post Title
date: 2023-12-20
---

Your blog post content goes here...
```

### 4. Build and Serve Locally

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local development server. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view your site.

## Deployment to Vercel

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

### Using the Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Create a Vercel Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).

2. **Import Your Git Repository:** In your Vercel dashboard, click on "New Project" and import your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

3. **Configure the Project:**
    *   **Framework Preset:** Select `Other`.
    *   **Build Command:** Enter `mkdocs build -d public` and turn the Override **on**.
    *   **Output Directory:** Enter `public` and turn the Override **on**.
    *   **Install Command:** Enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` and turn the Override **on**.
    *   **Development Command:** Enter `mkdocs serve` and turn the Override **on**.

    **Important:** You need to configure these settings even if you have a `vercel.json` file because the `builds` section in `vercel.json` overrides the Build & Development Settings in the Vercel dashboard.

4. **Deploy:** Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.

### Using the Vercel CLI

1. **Install the Vercel CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

2. **Deploy your project:**

    ```bash
    vercel
    ```

    Follow the prompts to link your project to your Vercel account.

3. **Deploy to production:**

    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```

## Troubleshooting

*   **404 Errors:** If you encounter 404 errors after deploying, double-check the following:
    *   Ensure that your `vercel.json` file is correctly configured with the `builds` section as described above.
    *   Confirm that the `outputDirectory` in your `vercel.json` file is set to `public`.
    *   Verify that your `mkdocs.yml` file specifies `site_dir: public`.
    *   Clear your Vercel project's cache by redeploying and unchecking "Use existing build cache."
*   **Other Build Errors:** Most build errors are caused by typos in `mkdocs.yml` or missing packages in `requirements.txt`. Carefully review your recent changes and the Vercel build logs for clues.
